 - Repository for holding my 2019/2020 Game Engines Unity Project.

# Project Proposal
 - An **interactive** Audio-Visualiser **game**
 - Players will take control of a **starship/turret** in the bottom centre of the screen
 - Whatever **audio** is being played in the background **will affect the visual space** on-screen
 - **Asteroids** will be **procedurally created** in the path of the player and they will need to destroy them to survive
 - The obstacles which arise will be **randomly generated** (i.e. things will not spwan in the same place or order on consecutive playthroughs)
 - Asteroids the player destroys and power-ups they collect will afford them **extra points**
 - Though there will be a score-system implemented, the **main goa**l of this project will be **to display impressive visuals** to the accompanying music track
